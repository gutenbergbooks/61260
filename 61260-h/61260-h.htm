<h4>Articles to make</h4>
<dl class="undent"><dt>One of the following first for practice</dt>
<dd>Head scarf&mdash;single</dd>
<dd>Head scarf&mdash;double</dd>
<dd>Sewing kit</dd>
<dd>TV slippers</dd>
<dt>An apron or skirt as your main project</dt>
<dd>Gathered skirt</dd>
<dd>Peasant apron</dd>
<dd>Elastic top apron</dd>
<dd>Cover-all apron</dd></dl>
<h4>Add to your record book</h4>
<p>Your County extension agent will give
you your 4-H record sheets. Keep your clothing
record up to date. Write your 4-H story
for the year when you complete your project.
Be sure to fill in your permanent record, too.
There are places on your permanent record
to show the activities you have participated
in&mdash;be sure to keep a record of them. Activities
plus project work make a well-rounded
4-H program.</p>
<h4>Learn to give a demonstration</h4>
<p>Show others what you have learned by
giving a demonstration at one of your club
meetings. When you show another club
member how to tie a knot or sew on a button,
you are giving a &ldquo;demonstration.&rdquo; Things
that are done or seen are remembered longest.
Give your demonstration alone or with
a partner. You will find demonstrations interesting
and helpful. Ask your leader to
give you ideas on how to give a demonstration.
Choose a topic you have studied in your
project.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">Plan your project</span></h2>
<p>You will want to talk about your project
with your mother and leader. This
will help you to understand your project.
Study the project outline and your record
book. Take your mother with you to your
first 4-H club meeting.</p>
<p>You will need your mother&rsquo;s cooperation
in selecting equipment and cloth.</p>
<p>Plan to do all your shopping at one time.
Buy the cloth for your apron or skirt and
slippers or scarf at the time you buy your
sewing equipment. This will save you time.</p>
<p>Before you go shopping make a list of all
of the things you will need. Think about the
blouses or dresses you have when you plan
the colors for your skirt or apron. You may
want to wear your scarf and skirt together&mdash;if
you do, plan the colors to go together.</p>
<p>This project is more than just sewing. You
will study health and good grooming and
how to care for your clothes.</p>
<p>Get off to a good start by learning how to
care for your shoes and how to sew on
buttons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">Take care of your clothing</span></h2>
<h3 class="inline" id="c4">Shine your shoes</h3>
<p>Daily care will improve the looks of
your shoes and will help make them
wear longer. Clean and polish your shoes.
Wipe them off with a clean (wool) cloth and
brush away the loose dirt before you put
them away. When they need polishing, use
one of the many good polishes that are on
the market. Select the kind that is best for
the leather in your shoes. Follow the directions
given with the polish.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p2.jpg" alt="Shoe" width="434" height="316" />
</div>
<p>Shoes become damp from perspiration
when you wear them. Wearing socks will
protect the lining. Allow your shoes to dry
thoroughly between wearings. Filling the
toes of your shoes with tissue paper will help
absorb the moisture.</p>
<p>Examine your shoes for signs of wear.
Keep the heels straight and do not wear the
sole through before having it repaired. Have
all rips mended as soon as they appear.</p>
<p>Do not place wet shoes near heat or in the
sun to dry. When they are dry, clean and
polish them to make them look like new.</p>
<p>Your dress is only as pretty as the shoes
you wear with it. Are you proud of the care
you give your shoes? Keep a record of the
care you give your shoes in your record book.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Sew on buttons</h3>
<p>To help mother care for the family clothing,
why don&rsquo;t you take the responsibility of
replacing buttons on shirts and blouses for
the family. Make a game of it with other
members of your club. Have a button contest.
Give yourself a point for each button
you sew on. The club could plan to give a
prize to the girl who sews on the most buttons
during the club year.</p>
<p>Keep a record of the buttons you sew on,
something like this:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr class="th"><th>Date </th><th>Article of clothing </th><th>Points&mdash;or number of buttons</th></tr>
<tr><td class="c"><input class="vl" name="input1" size="10" maxlength="10" /> </td><td class="c"><input class="vl" name="input2" size="20" maxlength="20" /> </td><td class="c"><input class="vl" name="input3" size="20" maxlength="20" /></td></tr>

</table>
<p>Record the total in your record book.</p>
<p>Use buttons to trim your bedroom slippers.
Select one flat, medium-sized one or
three small ones. Arrange them on the toes
of your slippers to make an attractive trim.</p>
<h5>How to sew on a button</h5>
<p>1. Make a small knot in double thread
(15 inches long). Fasten to article where
center of the button is to be placed. Take
two or three stitches over the knot.</p>
<p>2. Sew the button in place with one or
two stitches. See that the stitches run in the
same direction as the buttonhole.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p2d.jpg" alt="Sewing on a button" width="406" height="234" />
</div>
<p>3. Place a pin on top of buttons under the
first stitches. This makes a shank. Continue
to sew on the button. Take as many stitches
as necessary to hold the button securely.
When the stitches are in place, remove the
pin. Lift the button away from the article.
Wind the thread tightly around the stitches,
as shown, and fasten the thread on the back
by taking three or four stitches, one on top
of the other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Assemble your sewing tools</span></h2>
<p>You will need a sewing box or basket
and good sewing tools. Obtain a small
box to hold your tools and another one large
enough to hold your small box plus your
apron or skirt. A small suitcase makes an
ideal sewing box.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p2e.jpg" alt="Sewing tools" width="425" height="520" />
</div>
<h5>You will need</h5>
<p><i>Thimble</i>&mdash;This is for the middle finger.
Make sure of a snug fit. A thimble protects
your finger.</p>
<p><i>Needles</i>&mdash;A package of needles, assorted
sizes of 7 to 9 sharps, will give you the various
sizes needed. Use as fine a needle as will
carry the thread you are using.</p>
<p><i>Thread</i>&mdash;White mercerized thread No. 50
is used for basting. Match other thread to
your fabric.</p>
<p><i>Pins</i>&mdash;Select smooth fine dressmaker pins
so they will not leave a dark spot on your
cloth. These usually come in a box.</p>
<p><i>Pin cushion</i>&mdash;Plan for a pin cushion that
can be worn on the wrist. You may make or
buy this.</p>
<p><i>Scissors and shears</i>&mdash;Scissors have short
blades and are used for snipping threads and
cutting small pieces of material. Seven-inch
blades are a good length. Shears have one
long handle for the fingers and one short one
for the thumb. Scissors with bent handles
are handy because the cutting blade rests flat
on the table. Use plain scissors to cut out
your articles. Do not use pinking shears.</p>
<p><i>Tape measure</i>&mdash;Select a tape measure that
will wear well and one that is numbered with
&ldquo;1&rdquo; on each end on opposite sides.</p>
<p><i>Measuring gauge</i>&mdash;You can cut a gauge
from cardboard or buy a 4-inch metal one.
From the start, learn to measure accurately.
On a tape or measuring gauge, locate the
1-inch, &frac12;-inch, and &frac14;-inch marks.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Do your shopping</span></h2>
<h3 id="c8">Buying cotton fabric</h3>
<p>When you start to sew, it is most important
that you have a fine, firm piece
of cotton cloth. The best fabric for your
scarf, skirt, or apron is percale, either plain
or crease resistant. Percale is soft and firm,
and comes in figured and plain colors. Select
a small all-over pattern in colors that you
will enjoy wearing. Avoid plain colors,
plaids, or large designs. Also avoid cloth
which feels stiff. Crush several pieces of
cloth in your hand. You will be able to tell
the difference. Select the one that wrinkles
the least.</p>
<p>When you buy your fabric, be sure it is
preshrunk and colorfast. Also find out if it
is crease-resistant and how to wash it. Is it
hand washable or machine washable? You
will find most of this information on the end
of the bolt of fabric or on attached labels.
Study these and also ask the clerk to tell you
about the fabrics.</p>
<div class="img">

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Good percale has the same number of
threads in the warp as in the filling. The
warp threads are those that run the long way
of the fabric. The filling threads go back and
forth across the warp threads. The filling
threads are softer than the warp threads but
not as strong. Examine the edge of the fabric.
The edge is called selvage. It is stronger than
the rest of the cloth because it has more
threads in it. This may also cause it to shrink
more during washing.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p3.jpg" alt="Selvedge" width="448" height="228" />
</div>
<p>Percales should be torn, not cut, from the
bolt. This leaves a straight line or shows one
thread for the entire width of the cloth. Before
you buy any fabric, lay the folded cloth
on the counter and examine the torn end.
Are both sides even or is one side an inch
or so shorter than the other? Select a piece
which is reasonably even. Do not select fabric
if one side is more than &frac12;-inch shorter.</p>
<p>Border prints make interesting skirts.
Study the design on the cloth and buy
enough cloth so you can match the design
on the side seam. Make sure the fabric is
straight. Crooked fabric will give you a
curved side seam.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p3a.jpg" alt="I KNOW THESE FABRICS&mdash;DO YOU?" width="479" height="376" />
</div>
<p>Percale may be used for all the articles
you will make in this year&rsquo;s project. Other
fabrics that may be used are chambray, broadcloth,
poplin, and novelty fabrics.</p>
<p>Plan a shopping tour with your club before
buying your fabric. After studying the
different cotton fabrics, have your leader and
mother help you select the fabric for your
scarf, apron, or skirt. If you plan to make a
double scarf, buy &frac12; yard additional fabric like
your skirt and the same amount of a contrasting
color.</p>
<p>You will need two washcloths if you plan
to make the TV slippers. Select medium
weight washcloths either with or without
border trim.</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">Learn to use the sewing machine</span></h2>
<p>Many of you learned to use the sewing
machine in Phase 1 of <i>It&rsquo;s Fun to Sew</i>.
You will find this section of your bulletin to
be a good review.</p>
<p>For those of you who are starting with
this phase, this section will help you become
acquainted with the parts of the machine and
will tell you how to use it.</p>
<p><i>The needle</i>&mdash;Notice that it has an eye
near the point instead of at the top like the
one you use for hand sewing.</p>
<p><i>The presser foot</i>&mdash;See the two toes between
which the needle passes? This is the
presser foot. Find the small metal arm which
raises the presser foot up and down. The
metal arm is on the back of the machine.</p>
<p><i>The bobbin</i>&mdash;This carries the thread for
the underside of the sewing. Bobbins are
different shapes and sizes for different machines.
Learn to place the bobbin in the machine
and to remove it. Learn to wind the
bobbin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p><i>The balance wheel</i>&mdash;This is the wheel on
the right-hand side of the machine.</p>
<p>When you can recognize these parts and
know their use, you are ready to learn to run
the machine. Check these points before you
start to use the machine:</p>
<p>1. Remove the bobbin and top thread.</p>
<p>2. Have the needle up as far as it will go.</p>
<p>3. Raise the presser foot.</p>
<h4>How to start the machine</h4>
<p>You are now ready to get the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of
running the sewing machine. You will first
practice starting the machine off slowly and
evenly.</p>
<p>If you use an electric machine, you must
learn how much pressure to put on the knee
or foot control. Remember there is a lot of
power in an electric machine.</p>
<p>If you use a treadle machine, put both
feet on the treadle, one ahead of the other.
With your right hand, move the balance
wheel forward or back, whichever is right
for your kind of machine. Take your hand
off the balance wheel and treadle with your
feet, pressing first with your toes and then
with your heels. Practice treadling until you
can run it smoothly at a moderate speed.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p3c.jpg" alt="Sewing." width="424" height="555" />
</div>
<h4>How to stop the machine</h4>
<p>Try stopping the machine by slowing
down the treadling or releasing the pressure
on the electric control. With your right hand,
stop the balance wheel. Turn the wheel
slowly until the needle is raised as high as it
will go. Always do this when you stop the
machine. Practice starting and stopping. You
will do this many times while you are sewing.
Try stitching both forward and backward
if there is a reverse lever on your machine.</p>
<h4>Practice sewing on paper</h4>
<p>Now that you can run the machine, practice
sewing by first stitching on paper. Draw
some straight and curved lines on paper as
a guide to follow as you stitch. Here is how
to do it:</p>
<p>Place the end of a line under the needle.</p>
<p>Lower the presser foot. This holds the
paper securely and helps feed it through the
machine.</p>
<p>Start the machine by turning the balance
wheel. Treadle slowly or press on the foot
or knee release of the electric machine.</p>
<p>Guide the paper with both hands. Place
the left hand in back of the needle and the
right in front of the needle. Keep your hands
at a safe distance from the needle when
stitching.</p>
<p>When you can stitch straight and control
the speed of the machine, you are ready to
learn to thread the machine and start sewing
an easy-to-make article.</p>
<h4>Thread the machine</h4>
<p>You can best learn to thread the machine
by having your leader show you how to
thread it. Then practice while she watches
you. Watch closely when she draws the
bobbin thread to the top and see how she
pulls both threads back of the presser foot.
Learn about the tension. The tension determines
whether or not you have a good stitch.
Until you are older, have your leader or
mother adjust the tension for you. Watch her
while she does it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h4>Check the stitch</h4>
<p>Pull both top and bobbin threads back of
the presser foot. Place a double thickness
of cloth under the presser foot and make
several inches of stitching. Inspect the stitch.
Does it look the same on both sides? If not,
have the tension adjusted until it does.</p>
<p>Use 12 stitches to the inch for the type of
sewing you will be doing. Have your leader
show you how to adjust the length of the
stitch.</p>
<p>When you have finished sewing, raise the
needle as far as it will go. Raise the presser
foot and pull the fabric back about 4 inches
from the needle. Cut the thread with your
scissors or on the cutting knife on the side
of the needle-bar.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p4.jpg" alt="Sewing machine needle" width="364" height="338" />
</div>
<h4>Use a cloth gauge</h4>
<p>A cloth gauge placed to the right of the
needle will aid you in making straight seams.
Place a strip of colored scotch tape, band aid,
or adhesive tape to the right of the needle if
you do not have a gauge. Watch the edge of
your cloth as it follows along the gauge
rather than watching the needle when stitching.
This will help you make a straighter
seam.</p>
<h4>Your posture at the machine</h4>
<p>Posture is important. If you sit &ldquo;tall,&rdquo; you
will be less tired and will do better work.</p>
<h4>Become a 4-H machinist</h4>
<p>There is a special activity planned to help
you learn how to use the sewing machine.
It is called &ldquo;Know Your Sewing Machine.&rdquo;
Ask your leader and county home agent
about this.</p>
<p>Learning to use the machine is the most
important part of this clothing project and
it is a lot of fun. Bring your mother to club
with you the day you study machines so she
can enjoy it with you. When you have
learned to use the machine and can pass your
test for a 4-H sewing machinist, your leader
will sign your certificate. You are now ready
to start to sew.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">Learn to press cotton</span></h2>
<p>Examine the iron&mdash;locate the different
parts. Set the heat indicator of your iron
for cotton. This will keep the iron at the
correct temperature.</p>
<p>Cotton may be ironed on either the right
or the wrong side. If your fabric does not
iron out smoothly or take a sharp crease,
dampen it. Here is how to do it:</p>
<p>Dampen a piece of cheesecloth and
squeeze it tight. Do not make it wet. Place it
over the cloth you want to press and set iron
on it. Steam will form and dampen the cloth.</p>
<p>Always iron or press with the grain of the
cloth. Follow the warp or the filling threads.
Do not iron on the bias.</p>

<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">Sew&mdash;have fun</span></h2>
<p>Now that you have practiced using the
sewing machine, you are ready to make
a scarf, slippers, or sewing kit.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Make a scarf</h3>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p4d.jpg" alt="Wearing a scarf" width="228" height="327" />
</div>
<p>This scarf may be made larger than the
measurements suggested but it will require
more fabric. Using these measurements, a
square of cloth can be cut into four scarves.
It will be more economical to cut a scarf this
way if four in your club use the same colored
fabric.</p>
<p>Plan to have your scarf match or look nice
with your skirt. For a double scarf, have one
side the same as your skirt fabric and one a
plain or contrasting color. A single scarf
may either match your skirt or be a contrasting
color.</p>
<h4>Double scarf</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p4e.jpg" alt="Scarf Pattern" width="301" height="172" />

<p>To make the hem, turn the edge of the
fabric over &frac14; inch and press. Turn this over
once again and press. Pin or baste around the
hem. Pressing eliminates many hours of
basting.</p>
<p>Miter the corners. Open the corners and
fold along diagonal dotted line as shown in
the diagram. Refold the hem and press.</p>
<p>Start to stitch in the center of one side
and continue to stitch all around the square.
Stitch as near the edge of the hem as possible.
Remove your sewing kit from the machine
when you finish stitching and tie ends
of the threads. Pull out the basting and press
your sewing kit. Trim off the extra fabric in
each corner.</p>
<p>Place an 8 x 12-inch pocket in the center
of this square to hold your pattern and sewing
equipment. See &ldquo;Pockets,&rdquo; <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5f.jpg" alt="Slippers" width="493" height="249" />
</div>
<p>Materials needed:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">2 washcloths</p>
<p class="t0">thread to match</p>
<p class="t0">2 10-inch pieces of &frac14;-inch elastic</p>
<p class="t0">wool yarn for pompons or flat buttons</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>1. Fold each cloth in half. If there is a
design on two sides, fold the cloth so the
design is at the top. Stitch 4 inches from
folded edge for top. Make a &frac14;-inch seam.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5g.jpg" alt="Folded sewing kit" width="517" height="271" />
</div>
<p>Stitch from fold to edge of cloth for heel
on other end of washcloth. Stand on a ruler
and measure length of your foot. Add 1&frac12;
inches to this length to get the size needed
for your slipper. Example: foot&mdash;9 inches,
plus 1&frac12; inches equal 10&frac12; inches. Your seam
will be at this point. Most washcloths are 12
inches square. You would have a heel seam
1&frac12; inches wide.</p>
<p>2. Turn seams to inside. Open the heel
seam.</p>
<p>3. Fold the edges over 2 inches to the
outside of the slipper. Pin or paste in place.
Stitch &frac12; inch from folded edge to make a
casing for the elastic. Tie or back tack ends
of thread.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5h.jpg" alt="Casing for elastic" width="444" height="218" />
</div>
<p>4. Thread elastic through casing. Use
medium-size safety pin. Pin to one end of
elastic and thread elastic through casing.
Start at opening of front toe. Pull both ends
so they extend out from slipper. Overlap
ends &frac12; inch and sew them together.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5k.jpg" alt="Threading elastic" width="420" height="149" />
</div>
<p>Pull on heel and toe seam and the slippers
will cover the elastic. Trim your slippers
with pompons or buttons.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5m.jpg" alt="Making pompons" width="482" height="270" />
</div>
<p>5. To make the pompons, use a four-tined
table fork. Cut a piece of yarn about 6 inches
long and place through the center tine of the
fork. Bring both ends down and hold next to
the handle. Now wrap the yarn around the
tines, either weave it in and out of the tines
or wrap smoothly around. When the tines
are completely covered, bring the two ends
which you are holding with the handle up
around the other yarn and tie a knot, at the
same time slipping the yarn from the fork.
Tie securely. Clip through looped ends and
fluff into a ball.</p>
<p>Sew pompons to center front of slipper to
cover opening for elastic.</p>
<p>You may use buttons to trim your slippers
instead of the pompons. Select flat buttons
that can be washed. Use one average or large
button or three small ones on each toe. (See
&ldquo;How to sew on a button,&rdquo; <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a>.)</p>
<p>Select yarn or buttons that will look nice
on your slippers. They may be the same color
as the slippers or another color that will look
good on them. Try several colors. Medium
colored buttons rather than black or other
dark colors look best on pale colored slippers.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>Aprons and skirts are fun and easy to
make. This will probably be the first apron
or skirt you have ever made all by yourself.
Your leader will show you how to make it,
step by step. Follow her instructions and
you will learn to sew in no time at all. Learn
to do each step right the first time.</p>
<h4>Choose one that you would like to make</h4>
<p>1. Peasant-type skirt</p>
<p>2. Peasant apron with straight band</p>
<p>3. Peasant apron with elastic top</p>
<p>Plan to have one or two pockets on your
apron or skirt.</p>
<h3 id="c16">Peasant apron with band</h3>
<p>You will need to buy:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>30 inches of 39-inch percale or other firm cotton fabric&mdash;if you are taller you will need more material to make your apron longer.</dt>
<dt>1 spool of matching thread</dt></dl>

<h4>Measure and cut your apron</h4>
<p>Mark the apron according to the diagram.</p>
<table class="center">
<tr><td class="l">Band </td><td class="l">6&frac12; x 18 inches</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Apron skirt </td><td class="l">20 x 32&frac12; inches</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">Two sashes </td><td class="l">32&frac12; x 5 inches</td></tr>
<tr><td class="l">One or two pockets </td><td class="l">6&frac12; x 5 inches</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Measure and mark off these pieces with
chalk or pins before cutting. Cut with long,
even strokes.</p>
<h4>Make your sashes</h4>
<p>Fold the right sides of each sash together.
Place pins across the stitching lines as shown
in the diagram. Make a &frac14;-inch seam along the
side and end of the sash. Backstitch for two
or three stitches to make the end of your
thread secure. Trim off the corner.</p>
<p>Check the stitch on your machine. Be sure
it looks the same on both sides of the fabric.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6d.jpg" alt="Stitched sash" width="410" height="75" />
</div>
<p>Press the seam open and turn the sash.
Use the end of a table knife or ruler for
turning. Press the sash flat, keeping the seam
at the edge. Make the corners square.</p>
<p>If you prefer to hem the sash, make a &frac14;-inch
hem, miter the corners. See instructions
on scarf, pages <a href="#Page_7">7</a> and <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.</p>
<h4>Press and stitch hems</h4>
<h5>Side hems</h5>
<p>1. Make a &frac14;-inch hem on each side of the
apron. To make a hem, press a &frac14;-inch fold
on the side edges of your apron (20-inch
sides). Press with your fingers, then with the
iron.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6e.jpg" alt="First turn" width="364" height="90" />
</div>
<p>2. Fold edge over again &frac14; inch and press.
Stitch along edge of hem. This completes
the hem.</p>
<p><i>Selvage edge</i>&mdash;If the selvage is used, clip
only the very edge of it every 2 or 3 inches.
This prevents puckering when it is laundered.
Fold the edge over &frac14; inch, press and
stitch. A double hem is not needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<h5>Bottom hem</h5>
<p>Make a 3-inch hem on the bottom of your
apron. Measure and turn &frac14;-inch fold at bottom
of apron. Press. From this edge measure
3 inches, fold, and press. Pin and stitch the
hems. Use matching thread. Stitch as near as
you can to the edge of the hem. Backstitch
on both ends of hem.</p>
<h4>Gather the top edge</h4>
<p>Divide the top edge of your skirt into
four equal parts.</p>
<p>Set your cloth guide for a &frac14;-inch seam.
Lengthen your stitch to make the largest
stitch possible.</p>
<p>Make three rows of stitching along the
top of the apron, placing rows &frac14; inch apart.
Place the first row &frac14; inch from the edge. Be
sure to follow the guide.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6f.jpg" alt="Gathered top edge" width="446" height="171" />
</div>
<h4>Make your apron band</h4>
<p>Your apron band is made the same way as
a skirt band, only the proportions are different.
Turn to <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a> for illustrations.</p>
<p>1. Press a &frac12;-inch fold along one side of
your 18-inch band. Divide the band, lengthwise
into three equal parts. This gives three
2-inch sections. Make the section with the
&frac12;-inch fold slightly shorter than the other
two sections. Place a damp press cloth over
the folded band and press sharp creases along
the folds.</p>
<p>2. The section with the &frac12;-inch fold is the
front of your band. The double part is the
back. Stitch criss-cross through the back part
of the band. You can stitch straighter if you
make a guide or pattern. Cut a strip of waxed
paper the length and width of your band,
18 x 2 inches.</p>
<p>Fold in four equal sections.</p>
<p>Then fold it diagonally. Then diagonally
again. Open the paper and pin it to the band
and follow the creases in the paper. This will
give practice on starting and stopping the
machine and on turning corners. Tear the
paper away after the stitching is completed.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6g.jpg" alt="Apron band" width="337" height="166" />
</div>
<p>3. Pin and sew the end of the sashes to
the end of the band. Fold the band right
sides together, and stitch across ends. Do
not sew the &frac12;-inch fold at bottom of band
into the seam.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6h.jpg" alt="Apron band" width="449" height="110" />
</div>
<p>Stitch both sides. Turn and press along
the original crease.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p6k.jpg" alt="Band on apron" width="428" height="168" />
</div>
<h4>Sew apron to band</h4>
<p>Be sure the edges of the band and apron
are marked in four equal parts. Place the
right side of the apron to the right side of
the band. Match the quarter marks and pin.
Place the hemmed ends of the apron at the
seam ends of the band. Ease in the fullness
in the apron until it fits the band. Pull all
bobbin threads from each end at the same
time. Pull gently so you do not break the
threads. Spread the gathers so they are even
and pin. Baste along the second row of gathering
and the crease in the band. Machine
stitch along the bastings. Press.</p>
<p>Pin so back edge of band is &#8539; inch longer
than edge of front of band. Top stitch along
front edge of band. This finishes your band.
Be sure to press the band before you stitch.
It will make stitching easier.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h5>Add your pockets</h5>
<p>Pockets are for both use and decoration.
Make patch pockets that are securely stitched
and have no raw edges at the top.</p>
<p>Press the side and bottom hems of the
pocket first. Then fold the top hem over and
stitch in place. Study the most convenient
location for your pocket. Baste it in place.
Check to see that it is even. Reinforce the
top of the pocket with double stitching, as
shown in the drawing. Stitching is &frac14; inch
apart.</p>

<h4>Gather the top</h4>
<p>1. Make a heading or hem at the top of
your apron. From the top edge of the apron,
measure down &frac34; inch and mark with pins
or chalk. Start stitching at upper corner and
slope to &frac34;-inch line. Stitch across the apron
and slope up to the corner.</p>

<p>Fasten the knotted thread in the fold of
the hem. Slip the needle through the fold for
about &frac12; inch. Pick up one thread in the skirt
or, if the fabric permits, split a thread with
the needle. This thread should lie at right
angles to the hem edge. Slip the needle back
into the fold of the fabric, and continue hemming.
Stitches are almost as invisible on the
wrong side as the right side of the skirt.</p>

<h3 id="c18">Gathered skirt</h3>
<p>Select fabric that is colorful and gay for
your skirt. Closely woven cloth will be easy
to sew and will hold a sharp crease.</p>
<p>You will need from 3 to 3&frac12; yards of fabric
for your skirt. The more fabric you try to
gather in your skirt the harder it will be to
make. For the girl of average height cut your
skirt as follows:</p>
<h4>How to cut your skirt</h4>
<p>Cut or tear a 6&frac12;-inch strip from one side
of your skirt fabric. Measure in from the
selvage edge. Use this for the skirt band and
pockets. There will be some left over.</p>
<p>Tear off the selvage edge from the large
piece.</p>
<div class="img">

<dt>SELVAGE</dt>
<dt>BAND</dt>
<dt>POCKET</dt>
<dt>POCKET</dt>
<dt>CUT OR TEAR</dt>
<dt>SELVAGE</dt></dl>
<p>You may have to cut the band from the
end of your fabric instead of the side if you
are tall and need the extra length.</p>
<p>The above method of cutting gives you
one seam on the placket side.</p>
<p>Sometimes the design in the fabric will
be more attractive if the skirt is cut in several
lengths. When this is necessary, you will
have three or four seams in your skirt. This
may make a difference in the amount of fabric
you will need, so decide how you will cut
your skirt before buying your fabric.</p>
<h4>Make your skirt</h4>
<p>Pin the short edges together to make the
side seam. Make the seam 1&frac14; inches wide. It
is to be used for the placket. When finished,
the placket will be on the left side.</p>
<p>Stitch the side seam. Stitch the seam from
the bottom up. At a point 5 inches from the
top, turn and stitch half way across the seam.
Turn both edges of the seam toward the front
section and press.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p7m.jpg" alt="Stitched seam" width="429" height="278" />
</div>
<p>Trim the seams. Start at the bottom of
the wide seam and trim it to &#8541; inch wide up
to the placket. Do not trim above this point.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p7n.jpg" alt="Trimmed seam" width="431" height="323" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<h4>Finish the placket</h4>
<p>1. Baste and stitch a &frac12;-inch hem on the
back edge of the placket.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8.jpg" alt="Hem on placket" width="448" height="300" />
</div>
<p>2. Fold the front edge of the placket even
with seam line. Press. Now fold again to
make a complete hem. Baste.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8e.jpg" alt="Pinned placket" width="445" height="304" />
</div>
<p>Pin placket together. Stitch from the top
to the bottom of the placket, turn and stitch
across the end of first stitching. Pull threads
through and tie ends. This is a strong, easy-to-make
placket.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8f.jpg" alt="Stitched placket" width="452" height="282" />
</div>
<h4>Hem the skirt</h4>
<p>Skirts look best with hand-stitched hems.
Make the hem before placing the band on the
skirt. Unless you have poor posture, it will
hang even. Decide how long you would like
your finished skirt to be. Be careful not to
make it too short. Measure from the top edge
to the length you would like the skirt to be
and press in the hem. Turn the top edge of
the hem under &frac12; inch. Your skirt will be prettier
if you make a wide hem&mdash;3 inches or
wider.</p>
<p>When the hem has been carefully pressed,
stitch &#8539; inch from the fold of the top edge of
the hem, to keep the fold in place. Pin hem
in place. Ask your leader to show you a hand
hemming stitch.</p>
<h4>Place gathering threads at top of skirt</h4>
<p>Make a long stitch on your machine. Use
size 50 top thread and heavy duty for bobbin
thread.</p>
<p>Using the guide on your machine, stitch
around the top of your skirt &frac14; inch from the
edge. Make two more rows &frac14; inch apart. You
are now ready to make your skirt band.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8g.jpg" alt="Gathering treads" width="409" height="201" />
</div>
<h4>Make the skirt band</h4>
<p>1. Measure your waist. Add 2&frac12; inches.
This will give you the length needed for
your skirt band. Cut your band 6&frac12; inches
wide.</p>
<p>2. Press a &frac12;-inch fold along one side of
your band. From the folded edge divide the
rest into three sections. This gives three 2-inch
sections. Make the section with the
&frac12;-inch fold slightly shorter than the other
two sections. Press.</p>
<p>3. The section with the &frac12;-inch fold is the
front of your band. Stitch criss-cross through
the back part of the band. You can stitch
straighter if you make a guide or pattern.
Cut a strip of waxed paper the length and
width of your band, 24 x 2 inches.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8h.jpg" alt="Cross-stitched band" width="475" height="100" />
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Fold it in six equal sections. Then fold it
diagonally. Then diagonally again. Open the
paper and pin it to the band and follow the
creases in the paper. This will give practice
on starting and stopping the machine and on
turning corners. Tear the paper away after
the stitching is completed.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8k.jpg" alt="Folded paper for band" width="482" height="188" />
</div>
<p>4. Stitch a &frac12;-inch seam at the ends of the
band. Turn and press. Do not sew the &frac12;-inch
fold at the bottom of band into the seam.</p>
<h4>Gather in fullness</h4>
<p>Divide both your skirt and the skirt band
into eight equal parts to help you make the
gathers even in your skirt. Do not include
the placket or 1-inch overlap at the end of
the band. Mark with colored threads. Mark
the skirt band so the extension or extra
length will be on the back of the placket.
The front of band will be even with the front
edge of the placket.</p>
<p>Pin and stitch band to skirt.</p>
<p>Pin the pieces together, right side of skirt
to right side of band. Match dividing marks
that you have made. Gently pull on the gathering
threads at the side seams, the center
front, and the center back. Pull the threads
until they are the same length as the band.
Work with the gathers until they are even.
Baste and stitch along &frac12;-inch fold on the
skirt band.</p>
<h4>Top stitch the band</h4>
<p>Fold the double section of your band toward
the back and baste the edge of the band
to the skirt. Baste it so the folded edge hangs
just below the stitching you just made on
the front side of the band. Machine stitch
from the front side of the band. Place the
stitching as near the edge of the band as
you can. Press before you stitch. It will
flatten the seam and make stitching easier.</p>
<h4>Press your skirt</h4>
<p>Press your skirt. Use a dampened cheese-cloth
and an iron set for ironing cotton, or
use a steam iron. A skirt must be well pressed
and fresh looking to be pretty.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8m.jpg" alt="Pressed skirt" width="499" height="389" />
</div>
<h4>Fastenings for the skirt</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8n.jpg" alt="Fastenings" width="432" height="398" />
</div>
<p>Study the drawing above. It shows the
placing for fasteners on your skirt. Sewing
them in this position will keep the placket
from gaping. Sew a snap fastener in the center
of the placket if it is needed to keep it
closed. Do not try to set in a zipper. Use
hooks and eyes or buttons for fastening this
band.</p>
<p><i>Buttons and buttonholes</i>&mdash;When buttons
and buttonholes are used, make the buttonhole
lengthwise of the band. Place it far
enough from the end of the band so there
will be at least &frac14; inch beyond the button
when it is sewed in place. Measure half the
distance across your button and add &frac14; inch
for this measurement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>Learn to use the machine attachment for
making buttonholes. They are stronger and
easier for you to make than hand-made buttonholes.
Have your leader, mother, or a
neighbor set it up for you and show you how
to use it. After you have made a few sample
buttonholes, make some in your apron or on
your skirt. If you have a machine with a
zig-zag stitch, learn to make buttonholes
on it.</p>
<p>Pin the band together and mark place for
buttons. See <a href="#Page_2">page 2</a> for instructions for sewing
on buttons.</p>
<h4>Sew fasteners to skirt band</h4>
<p><i>Snaps</i>&mdash;Examine the snap fasteners. One
part has a ball on top. This is placed on the
front part or top of your placket. The other
part has a hole or socket and is placed on the
back or under part of the placket. Place
them exactly opposite each other on your
placket.</p>
<p>Sew the top snap on first. Mark the placing
of the bottom part of the snaps by rubbing
chalk on the ball and then pinning
placket together. Press ball against fabric.
The chalk will rub off and mark the exact
spot to sew the under part of the snap.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p9.jpg" alt="Snap fasteners" width="554" height="528" />
</div>
<p>Sew snap fasteners on with several over-and-over
stitches. Be sure to hide your knot
under the snap. Sew securely through all
four holes. When you cross from one hole
to the other, take a stitch in the cloth and
bring your needle up from the under side to
the next hole.</p>
<p><i>Hooks and eyes</i>&mdash;Each package of hooks
and eyes, has two types of eyes, a round and
a straight. Use the round eye for your skirt.
Sew the hook on the inside edge of the
top part of your band. (You will need two.)
Sew these with several over-and-over stitches.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p9a.jpg" alt="Hooks and eyes" width="408" height="222" />

<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">Complete your record book</span></h2>
<p>Your record book is important. Examine
it carefully. Have you completed your clothing
record? Have you recorded your activities
as well as your project summary on your
permanent record? Have you written your
4-H story for the year? In your story tell
how you feel about the things you have made
and the experiences you have had.</p>
<p>Each year your record book will add another
chapter to your 4-H Club story. You
will have fun looking back at each chapter
as the years go by. Is this chapter as complete
as you would like it to be?</p>
<p>You may want to keep a scrapbook of pictures
and newspaper stories to go along with
your record book.</p>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">Show others what you have learned</span></h2>
<h3 id="c22">Exhibits</h3>
<p>It is fun to let others see what you have
done. Your club may want to plan a display
for your families. You may want to exhibit
your work at a fair. If you do, your exhibit
will be the main article you made. Be
sure your article is clean and pressed and
clearly labeled so it can be returned to you.</p>
<h3 id="c23">Give a demonstration</h3>
<p>A demonstration means &ldquo;to show someone
else how to do something.&rdquo; Select one small
subject for your demonstration. Avoid one
that has too many parts or details. Here are
some suggestions:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>How to sew on a button</dt>
<dt>How to make a pocket</dt>
<dt>How to shine your shoes</dt>
<dt>How to thread a needle</dt>
<dt>How to thread a sewing machine</dt>
<dt>How to make a scarf</dt>
<dt>How to make washcloth slippers</dt>
<dt>How to make a mitered corner</dt>
<dt>How to make a hem</dt>
<dt>How to make gathers</dt>
<dt>How to make a sash for an apron</dt>
<dt>How to make a skirt band</dt>
<dt>How to make a hemmed placket</dt></dl>
<p>Because everything you use for sewing is
small, you will need to make your samples
large. Use contrasting thread, large stitches,
and make large buttons so the audience can
see what you are doing.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">Are you ready for the next project?</span></h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">1. Have you kept your shoes clean and shining?</p>
<p class="t0">2. Have you studied and improved your health habits?</p>
<p class="t0">3. Have you sewed buttons on family clothing?</p>
<p class="t0">4. Have you kept your record book up to date?</p>
<p class="t0">5. Have you made two or more articles?</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
